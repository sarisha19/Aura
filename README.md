# Aura
Flask application using Spotipy library

Get the user's top songs, the average danceability, energy and valence with appropriate colours chosen for each parameter, and generate a playlist for the user with recommendations.

Orange-blue for high and low danceability, yellow-purple for high and low valence and red-green for high and low energy.

Since app is in the development mode as per spotify requirements, users need to be individually added by the creatot in order to use the application.
